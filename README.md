Advent of Code 2020
===================

My [AoC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solutions, written in Rust. My main aim is to make the
code as complicated as I can (so - many traints, much generics), learning the "advanced" rust along
the way :) I might not succeed in all the cases, but I will strive to at least make the solutions
look... nice :)
